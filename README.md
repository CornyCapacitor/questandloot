# Quest & Loot ðŸ‘¾
The *Quest & Loot* project has been an invaluable learning experience, highlighting the complexities of establishing a secure and robust connection between the frontend and backend. Through this project, I discovered that using WebSockets safely and efficiently requires a fundamentally different approach compared to traditional RESTful server communication.

Throughout development, I tackled several key challenges, including configuring both REST and WebSocket (IO) connections within a single server, implementing access restrictions based on player data from the database, and enhancing replayability by adapting the game model to an endless mode structure. This project significantly improved my ability to design scalable and secure real-time communication in web applications.
